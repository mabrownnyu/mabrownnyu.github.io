Early career researchers (ECR) in communication and media research face increasing problems and stressors due to systemic challenges in academia, including the precarity of being an ECR and the politicization of research and targeting of researchers. For researchers studying harmful content online (HCO), research-related trauma (RRT) can compound these stressors. In this study, we present results from interviews with 18 ECRs from communication studies and adjacent disciplines studying HCO. We find researchers frequently experience RRT from harmful content, pressure from superiors to conduct research on harmful content, and outside harassment related to their research. In addition, researchers frequently use individualized self-care practices for dealing with RRT or couch their trauma. Drawing from widespread consensus by our participants that their needs are not being institutionally met, we offer a vision of what an ethics of care framework for ECRs should provide.
