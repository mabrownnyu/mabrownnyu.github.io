											<dt>SARS-CoV-2 titers in wastewater foreshadow dynamics and clinical presentation of new COVID-19 cases</dt>
											<dd>
												<p>With Fuqing Wu, Amy Xiao, Jianbo Zhang, Katya Moniz, Noriko Endo, Frederica Armas, Richard Bonneau, Mary Bushman, Peter R. Chai, Claire Duvallet, Timothy B. Erickson, Katelyn Foppe, Newsha Ghaeli, Xiaoqiong Gu, William P. Hanage, Katherine H. Huang, Wei Lin Lee, Mariana Matus, Kyle A. MacElroy, Jonathan Nagler, Steven T.

												<p>June 23, 2020</p>
												<p>Current estimates of COVID-19 prevalence are largely based on symptomatic, clinically diagnosed cases. The existence of a large number of undiagnosed infections hampers population-wide investigation of viral circulation. Here, we use longitudinal wastewater analysis to track SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in wastewater at a major urban wastewater treatment facility in Massachusetts, between early January and May 2020. SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in wastewater on March 3. Viral titers in wastewater increased exponentially from mid-March to mid-April, after which they began to decline. Viral titers in wastewater correlated with clinically diagnosed new COVID-19 cases, with the trends appearing 4-10 days earlier in wastewater than in clinical data. We inferred viral shedding dynamics by modeling wastewater viral titers as a convolution of back-dated new clinical cases with the viral shedding function of an individual. The inferred viral shedding function showed an early peak, likely before symptom onset and clinical diagnosis, consistent with emerging clinical and experimental evidence. Finally, we found that wastewater viral titers at the neighborhood level correlate better with demographic variables than with population size. This work suggests that longitudinal wastewater analysis can be used to identify trends in disease transmission in advance of clinical case reporting, and may shed light on infection characteristics that are difficult to capture in clinical investigations, such as early viral shedding dynamics.

											<dt>Cross-Platform State Propaganda: Russian Trolls on Twitter and YouTube during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election</dt>
											<dd>
												<p>With Yevgeniy Golovchenko, Cody Buntain, Gregory Eady, and Joshua A. Tucker</p>
												<p>April 19, 2020</p>
												<p>This paper investigates online propaganda strategies of the Internet Research Agency (IRA)—Russian “trolls”—during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. We assess claims that the IRA sought either to (1) support Donald Trump or (2) sow discord among the U.S. public by analyzing hyperlinks contained in 108,781 IRA tweets. Our results show that although IRA accounts promoted links to both sides of the ideological spectrum, “conservative” trolls were more active than “liberal” ones. The IRA also shared content across social media platforms, particularly YouTube—the second-most linked destination among IRA tweets. Although overall news content shared by trolls leaned moderate to conservative, we find troll accounts on both sides of the ideological spectrum, and these accounts maintain their political alignment. Links to YouTube videos were decidedly conservative, however. While mixed, this evidence is consistent with the IRA’s supporting the Republican campaign, but the IRA’s strategy was multifaceted, with an ideological division of labor among accounts. We contextualize these results as consistent with a pre-propaganda strategy. This work demonstrates the need to view political communication in the context of the broader media ecology, as governments exploit the interconnected information ecosystem to pursue covert propaganda strategies.

								        <p>March 3, 2020</p>
								        <p>We analyzed 11,286,346 tweets collected over the course of the first nine debates, which spanned across 11 nights from June 26, 2019 to February 19, 2020.
								          We found that civil rights and healthcare were particularly popular policy issues amongst tweeters. Conservatives were more likely to tweet about immigration,
								          and the economy, while liberals were more likely to tweet about civil rights, education, and the environment. Read the full report below.

													<p>By Leon Yin</p>
					  							<p>urlExpander is inteded to be used by social media researchers who want to do analysis of links.
														Aside from collecting in-depth user engagement data, these services obfuscate the destination of the shortened URLs.
														urlExpander was created to address this challenge in a scalable and robust manner. It does so by providing
														utility functions to convert Tweets into link datasets, filter for known for link-shortening services (like bit.ly),
														resolve shortened links, and parse the title and meta description from webpages. urlExpander and offers multithreaded
														url expansion. The multithreaded url expansion was created to overcome the bottleneck of mass link expansion
														through parallelization, minimizating http requests, caching results, and chunking the input into smaller pieces.
