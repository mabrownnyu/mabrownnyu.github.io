  							<h2>Cross-Platform State Propaganda: Russian Trolls on Twitter and YouTube during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election</h2>
                <p>With Yevgeniy Golovchenko, Cody Buntain, Gregory Eady, and Joshua A. Tucker</p>
                <p>April 19, 2020</p>
  							<p>This paper investigates online propaganda strategies of the Internet Research Agency (IRA)—Russian “trolls”—during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. We assess claims that the IRA sought either to (1) support Donald Trump or (2) sow discord among the U.S. public by analyzing hyperlinks contained in 108,781 IRA tweets. Our results show that although IRA accounts promoted links to both sides of the ideological spectrum, “conservative” trolls were more active than “liberal” ones. The IRA also shared content across social media platforms, particularly YouTube—the second-most linked destination among IRA tweets. Although overall news content shared by trolls leaned moderate to conservative, we find troll accounts on both sides of the ideological spectrum, and these accounts maintain their political alignment. Links to YouTube videos were decidedly conservative, however. While mixed, this evidence is consistent with the IRA’s supporting the Republican campaign, but the IRA’s strategy was multifaceted, with an ideological division of labor among accounts. We contextualize these results as consistent with a pre-propaganda strategy. This work demonstrates the need to view political communication in the context of the broader media ecology, as governments exploit the interconnected information ecosystem to pursue covert propaganda strategies.</p>

  							<h2>Debate Twitter: Mapping User Reactions to the 2020 Democratic Presidential Primary Debates</h2>
  							<p>With Zhanna Terechshenko, Niklas Loynes, Tom Paskhalis, and Jonathan Nagler</p>
                <p>March 3, 2020</p>
                <p>We analyzed 11,286,346 tweets collected over the course of the first nine debates, which spanned across 11 nights from June 26, 2019 to February 19, 2020.
                  We found that civil rights and healthcare were particularly popular policy issues amongst tweeters. Conservatives were more likely to tweet about immigration,
                  and the economy, while liberals were more likely to tweet about civil rights, education, and the environment. Read the full report below.
